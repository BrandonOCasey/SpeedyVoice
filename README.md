This is my digital playground where I am learning. I'm integrating and validating new technologies and ideas here, playing around with new UI / UX components and developing with the best coding standard I come up with.

At the same time I want to provide an audiobook player which is really easy in use and a joy to work with.
There are still some components outdated.

If you like to [contribute](#contrib) or [translate](#trans), that is very appreciated. But there might be impacting structural changes over time.

## Development

If you wan to help check the label [PR-Welcome](https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22PR+welcome%22).
Its always a good idea to talk about what are going to do before you actually start it, so frustration can be avoided.

Some rules for coding:
* Use the code style the project uses
* For each feature, make a seperate branch, so it can be reviewed separately
* Use commits with a good description, so everyone can see, what you did

## <a name="trans">Translations</a>
The project page is on [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/PaulWoitaschek/voice/). There all the localizations are maintained. If you want to contribute, check if there are untranslated or wrong translated words.

Or you can start translating a new language if you speak it ;-)
